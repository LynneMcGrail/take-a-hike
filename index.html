                         Hiking can improve your cardiovascular health, whilst being active in nature is good for your soul. It can be of great benefit to your heart health, and overall helps build strength, especially in your core muscles and develop enhanced balance skills.

                        Hiking is not only good for your physical health, but also your mental well-being. It allows us to become present, to calm our nervous system and take time to reflect. Many members join to unplug from their day-to-day lives and enjoy the beauty of our surroundings here in Ireland.
