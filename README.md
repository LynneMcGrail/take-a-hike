## Design Choices ##

### Fonts ###
_______
In order to move away from the basic fonts available, I have used Google Fonts to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen Assistant as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look. I decided to use sans-serif as the back-up font option. This font is complimentary to Assistant.

IconsÂ 
_______
I will used some icons for my website from the Font Awesome library. These icons will only be used where there is no explination needed to their meaning, social media links, contact links and a hamburger for navigational links on smaller devices. All icons used will be styled and in keeping with the appearance of the website.

Colours
_______
I have used Colourmind to help in the selection of my colour scheme. I selected two colours that I wanted the reast of my pallet to fit with and then used the generator to create the pallet, it can be seen here (insert link). Need to test the contrast of the colours in WebAIM, (state pass or fail here). (Include any adjustments made).

I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from left to right. 

Colour Pallet (insert image of colours) 
_______

- #C9F4F4 - This colour will be used as a background colour for the navigation menu when items are hovered over.
- #13FFFF - This colour will be used as a background colour for text sections overlaying images with an appropriate text colour for readability.
- #F39D75 - This colour will be used on the contact form for added styling.
- #E36D50 - This colour will be used for styling the icons in the footer section 
- #3C3D4A - This colour will be used as a text colour and in any styling background where required.

## Structure ##
______
(insert bootstrap breakpoints here)
(media queries etc)

## Wireframes ##
______
I have used Balsamic (link) to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version and then the wireframes and then scalled it up for both tablet and desktop. Because a requirement is to give little but quality information to the user to make them want to engage with the club, a one-page website is used. This gets the user through the content and quickly to the contact form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes are below:

(insert desktop wireframe here)
(insert tablet wireframe here)
(insert mobile wireframe here)

# Features #

## Navigation Bar ##
______
The navigation bar is fully responsive to allow for various screen sizes. It includes links to manover around the site easily and the club logo which doubles as a link back to the home screen.

## Landing Page ##
_____

The landing page image chosen gives the user instant knowledge of what is involved in the hiking club, and with added zoom animation grabs their attention to the site.

The text gives instant information to the user on what the club is.

## About Section ##
_______
This welcomes the site user and gives an insight into what the club ethos is, so the potential member gets an idea of what the group they would be joining involves.
