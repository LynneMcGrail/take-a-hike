# PORTFOLIO PROJECT - 1 #

# Take a Hike #

## Goals for this project ##
#
#### Take a Hike is a website designed to introduce local people to the hiking club which provides an outlet for a range of age groups, from young adults (16+) up. It was set up during the pandemic to encourage people to move more, meet new people, explore more, and maybe for some, to take up a new activity. The website provides information about the club, information about the benefits of hiking, the upcoming hiking events to show a potential member the benefits of joining the group. It also allows the person to make contact with the club easily through social media links or directly via the contact form on the site. ####

## Final Design
![Final project image home page](assets/images/testing:am-i-responsive-test.png)

## Initial Idea Concept
My initial idea for the project was to create an informative and welcoming website about the activity of hiking in Ireland. My target audience is anyone who is interested in the activity itself or seeking to benefit their health and well-being, whilst meeting new people and establishing social connections.
This can be any person over the age of 16, any gender and any experience level. The site is safe for all age ranges from children to adults who want to learn about hiking in Ireland. I chose to make the site bright to display the information clearly and so people could navigate it easily.

* The Features I wanted the project to have are:
    * To make the site easy to read.
    * To have a light colour scheme (white background, dark text colour and complimenting bright colours throughout to represent nature which also tie in with the colours in the hero image).
    * To have an easy to navigate "Nav Bar".
    * Look fun and inviting with images, and to be educational on the health benefits.
    * To be easy to make contact with the club through social media or the contact form on the site.

# UX/UI
* This website was created to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML and CSS and to provide users with visual and educational content.
* The website should be easy to navigate.
* The website should be easy to read, and images should be clear without becoming stretched or squashed.

Site Goals:
* To showccase my skills in HTML and CSS.
* To provide users with an easy to understand and easy to navigate website.
* To provide users with enough information to decide if they'd like to join the club.
* To make the site easily accessible for all users.

## User Stories 
#
* As a user, I want to understand the main purpose of the website.
* As a user, know that the club is well established.
* As a user, I want the website to give me the health benefits of hiking.
* As a user, I want to be able to navigate the site with an easy to see and read nav bar.
* As a user, I want the site to be attractive.
* As a user, I want to know what events are taking place.
* As a user, I want to see images related to the hiking group.
* As a user, I want to be able to easily contact the club.

## Requirements ##
#
- Easy to navigate on various screen sizes.
- Clear information on the services provided.
- Keep the user interested with small bits of information to make them want to engage with the club.
- Simple methods of contacting the club.
- Visually inviting and readable, so users do not leave.

## Expectations ##
#
- I expect to know if a form has been submitted properly and if items are not filled in, to be prompted -e.g. error message if email address required and not input properly.
- I expect all links to social media sites to be opened in a new tab.
- I expect all navigation links to work correctly and open in the same tab, but navigate to the section selected in the nav bar.
- I expect screen size not to affect the quality of the website.
- I expect all information to be correct and accurate.

## Wireframes 

* I used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/) to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version, and then scalled it up for both tablet and desktop. Because one of my requirement is to give quality information to the user to make them want to engage with the club, a one-page website is used. This guides the user through the content and quickly to the contact form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes can be viewed [here]
(insert desktop wireframe here)
(insert tablet wireframe here)
(insert mobile wireframe here)

## Features 
* The site consists of:
    * 5 main sections on one page, `HOME, ABOUT, UPCOMING EVENTS, GALLERY, CONTACT US`
    * The page contains a `HEADER (TITLE)`, `NAVBAR`, `MAIN CONTENT (TEXT AND IMAGES)` and `FOOTER (SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS/LINKS`
* Navigation bar:
    * The navigation bar is fully responsive to allow for various screen sizes. It includes links to maneuver through the site easily with each menu option navigating to it's particular section.
(insert screenshots here)
* <img src="_insert screenshot" width=400>

* Footer:
* <img src="_insert screenshot" width=400>

* Layout and content:
    * The Header section will have some introductory text and a landing image.
    * The About section follows with an introduction to the club and a 'Why Join Us' section which provides valuable information to the user about the benefits of hiking. 
    * The Gallery will have multiple images of the club's members, to encourage the site user to join.
    * The Contact Us section will have a form to include first name, last name, email address and a submit button
    * The Thank-you page with have some thank-you text and a thumbs up logo 
    # (* ^ To be added ^ *) # 

* Hover effect on links and social media icons:
    * Indicates to the user the location of the mouse whilst navigating the menu
    * A straight underline helps the user to know which page they are currently on
    * <img src=" ^ insert screen grab ^ " width=400>

* Contact Form:
    * Form validation requests the user to input the correct information in the input fields, this avoids the user sending illegible text/email.
    * Added thank you page for submitting the form so that the user is reassured that their message has been sent.
    * <img src=" ^ insert screen grab here ^ " width=400>

## DESIGN
* Color Scheme:
    * With being a website that is both informative and fun, the color scheme chosen were colourful and bright to reflect nature and being outdoors. Bright background colours were used and then colourful elements to make sections 'pop' on the site to provide an appealing user experience. The foreground text and images will be darker and clear against the background so the site is readable. (shade of black) (See hex colours below)
    * The difference between the lighter background and darker text brings contrast to the site.
  
<img src=" ^ insert here ^ " width=200>
<img src=" ^ insert here ^ " width=200>
<img src=" ^ insert here ^ " width=200>

## Landing Page 
* The landing page image chosen gives the user instant association that the club is about hiking, and with added zoom animation, immediately grabs their attention to the site.
* The text gives instant information to the user on what the club is.
* (insert screenshot here)

## About Section 
* This section welcomes the site user and gives an insight into what the club ethos is, so the potential member gets a feel for the group they would be joining. 

## Images
* I sourced several images for the hero image, upcoming events and members gallery
* There are a total of 14 images across the site.
* All images have been compressed through `Tinypng.com`
* None of the images used have been pushed past the pixel limit in order to prevent image distortion

## Typography
* The fonts used on my site are "Assistant" and a backup of "Sans Serif", which is imported from Google Fonts. In order to move away from the basic fonts available, I have used Google Fonts to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. I felt the two fonts chosen, were complimentary of each other. 

## Design Choices 

IconsÂ 
#
I used some icons for my website from the Font Awesome library. These icons will only be used where there is no explination needed to their meaning, social media links, contact links and a hamburger for navigational links on smaller devices. All icons used will be styled and in keeping with the appearance of the website.

Colours
#
I have used Colourmind to help in the selection of my colour scheme. I selected two colours that I wanted the reast of my pallet to fit with and then used the generator to create the pallet, it can be seen here (insert link). Need to test the contrast of the colours in WebAIM, (state pass or fail here). (Include any adjustments made).

I will explain the uses of the varius colours below, starting from left to right. 

Colour Pallet (insert image of colours) 
#

- #C9F4F4 - This colour will be used as a background colour for the navigation menu when items are hovered over.
- #13FFFF - This colour will be used as a background colour for text sections overlaying images with an appropriate text colour for readability.
- #F39D75 - This colour will be used on the contact form for added styling.
- #E36D50 - This colour will be used for styling the icons in the footer section 
- #3C3D4A - This colour will be used as a text colour and in any styling background where required.

## Structure ##
#
(insert w3 schools media queries etc)

# Technologies used

* HTML
* CSS

## Programmes Used
* GIT
  * For version control, committing and pushing to github. 
* GITPOD 
  * The IDE used to code this website.
* GITHUB
  * Used to create and store repositories, files and images pushed from gitpod.
* Am I Responsive
  * Used to test the responsiveness of the website at different screen sizes 
* CHROME Developer Tools 
  * For checking compatibility, troubleshooting and editing code live to see what changes needed to be made.

  #
  # DEPLOYMENT
  ## Remote Deployment
  (Assuming you have already cloned or forked)
* Following writing the code, then committing and pushing to GitHub, this project was deployed using GitHub through the following the steps:

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click on the `Settings` icon at the top of page in the navigation bar
2. Scroll down until you see `Github Pages` on the side navigation
3. Choose the branch in the drop down box, in this case `Main`
4. Choose the directory in the next drop down box, in this case `Root`
5. Then click `Save`
6. It may take a few moments for the site to publish, but once live, the box at the top of the page with the site name will turn green and have a `Green` tick to the left of the link to the live site
7. Another way to find the live site is to navigate to settings, on the left menu click on `pages` and this will get you to the same point.
8. Now the website is now live on https://lynnemcgrail.github.io/take-a-hike/
9. If any changes are required, they can be done, commited and pushed to GitHub and the changes will be updated.

## Git Commands Used
The following commands were used for version control during project:

* git add `example filename` - to add files before committing.
* git commit -m `"example message"` - to commit changes to the local repository.
* git push - to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.
* git status to display the working area to see which changes have been staged and which haven't.
